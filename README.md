# Building core feature of Express - ROUTER

This is a simple own creation of my own basic router, similar to express.js and simple application to test the data. This router consists of following features:
- register routes associated callbacks with `app.get()` or `app.post()`,
- starts up a server with `app.listen()`
- parses Path Patterns and associates them with called routes in the browser
- parameterizes Routing so to get the params, matches patterns in the app with paths clled in the broswer on in bash
- enabled POST requests and parses POST data
- enabled RESTful HTTP methods: get, post, put, patch, delete


## Getting Started

```

and go to your browser to `localhost:4000`
